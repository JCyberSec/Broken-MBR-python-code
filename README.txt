This code works by inputting an image and then it searches through looking for key bytes. If it finds them then it out puts the sector where it was located. This code can output many false positives so it doesn't mean there is 100% a partition located there.

This code is good if you need to carve data out of a hard drive but the MRB is broken, or corrupted you can use the output of this code to locate the start of a partition.
